 1)                  set solder mask to 0.003 inches, per OSHPark suggestion.
 2)                  make footprint pads longer so that we have some metal not covered by the chip 
 3)                  since RST is not needed, connect with Pull-up resistor to VCC
 4)                  since EN is not needed, connect with Pull-up resistor to VCC
 5)                  it is highly recommended to connect the exposed pad to GND pins on the PCB.
 6)                  Up to 22mm height, any length
 7)                  double-row header on the long side planning for soldering usually or black header for quick proto
 8)                  output holes on the header using current larger drill size if geometry allows to enable wire soldering option. if geometry not allows just as large as geometry allows. top line of the header could be easier to solder?
 8)                  EN pin on the 2 row header, RST and SPI pins not on the header just in random spots. My thinking here is to reduce board size since at the moment no plans for SPI or RST.
 9)                  pull-down on EN line in addition to the pull-up, this would give flexibility to use either or both
10)                  GND +5v +3v pins close to each other since this could probably be universal part of the base board
11)                  maybe enlarge chip bottom pad holes a bit to increase the changes of solder wire soldering from the back through the board?
